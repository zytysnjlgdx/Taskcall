        Q: When Mary paints a house, it takes her 4 hours. When Lisa joins Mary, and they work together, it takes them only 3 hours to paint a house of the same size. How long would it take for Lisa to paint a house of the same size by herself? 
        Choices:  
        A)5 hr 
        B)6 hr 
        C)7 hr 
        D)12 hr 
        E)20 hr
        
        A: Here, the rate equation becomes:\n(# of houses) = (painting rate) x (time)\nWhen Mary paints a house, it takes her 4 hours. 
        Thus, (1 house) = (Mary\u2019s rate) x (4 hr), so her rate is 1\/4.\nWhen Mary & Lisa paint together, it takes 3 hrs. 
        Thus, (1 house) = (combined rate) x (3 hr) and the combined rate = 1\/3.\n
        To find a combined rate, we add individual rates.\n(combined rate) = (Mary\u2019s rate) + (Lisa\u2019s rate)\n
        1\/3 = 1\/4 + (Lisa\u2019s rate)\n(Lisa\u2019s rate) = 1\/3-1\/4=1\/3*4\/4-1\/4*3\/3=4\/12-3\/12=1\/12\nLisa\u2019s rate is 1\/12 of a house every hour, or in other words, 1 house in 12 hrs. 
        Thus, it would take her 12 hours to paint a house of the same size.\n
        The answer is D
        
        Q: At a casino, gamblers spin a number-wheel containing positive, two-digit numbers. If the gambler bets on a prime number, he\/she will win 2 times their bet, if the wheel shows that number. If the gambler bets on a non-prime number, he\/she only wins half their bet, if the wheel shows that number. If a gambler won $100, which of the choices is possible?\nI. bet $50 on 11\nII. bet $50 on 21\nIII. bet $200 on 89

        A: The numbers A, B, C belong a priori in the set f11; 13; 17; 19g|Note that the\naddition of any of these two 2-digit prime numbers cannot be greater than or equal to 30,\n
        which places a strong restriction on the greatest of the three numbers: this must be at most\n19. These are the only valid additions of any two numbers on that set:\n
        11 + 11 = 22, 11 + 13 = 24, 11 + 17 = 29, 11 + 19 = 30, 13 + 13 = 26, 13 + 17 = 30\n
        Note in particular the strict inequalities placed on the addition of any of these two numbers:\n
        22 _<A + C < B + C < A + B _<30\nSince C < B, there are only two possibilities for B+C at this point: B = 13,C = 11,B+C =\n24, or B = 17,C = 11,B + C = 29.\n

        There are {ori_tree_num} trees originally.
        Then there were {after_planted_tree_num} trees after some more were planted.
        So the number of trees planted today {today_planted_num} is the number of trees after planting {after_planted_tree_num} minus the number of trees before planting {ori_tree_num}.
        The answer is {today_planted_num} = {after_planted_tree_num} - {ori_tree_num}.
        
        ## Actual analysis and solution process
        
        In this question, {ori_tree_num} = 15 and {after_planted_tree_num} = 21.
        There are 15 trees originally. 
        Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. 
        So the number of trees planted today must have been 21 - 15 = 6.

        Originally, Leah had {Leah_num} Leah_num chocolates.
        Her sister had {sister_num} chocolates.
        So in total they had {all_num} = {Leah_num} + {sister_num} chocolates.
        After eating {eating_num} chocolates, the number of chocolates they have left {remain_num} is {all_num} minus {eating_num}. 
        The answer is {remain_num} = {all_num} - {eating_num}.
        
        ## Actual analysis and solution process
        
        In this question, {Leah_num} = 32, {sister_num} = 42 and {all_num} = 35.
        So, in total they had 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates originally.
        After eating 35 chocolates, they had 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates.

Q:Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
-options 
A)0 
B)55000 
C)38000 
D)70000 
E)105000

A:After reviewing the analysis and results provided by the other agents, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the interpretation of the problem. The key point of contention is the base value on which the 150% increase is calculated.

Agents 623T, 8GTW, and 7R9w have calculated the 150% increase based on the total investment (purchase price + repair costs), which is $130,000. They have then added this increase to the total investment to find the new value of the house, and subsequently calculated the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house. This approach leads to a profit calculation of $195,000.

Agent 3qfQ, however, has interpreted the problem differently. This agent suggests that the 150% increase should be calculated based on the initial purchase price only, not the total investment. Following this method, the increased value is calculated as $80,000 (initial purchase price) + ($80,000 * 1.5), which equals $200,000. The profit is then calculated by subtracting the total investment ($130,000) from this increased value, resulting in a profit of $70,000.

The problem statement is ambiguous because it does not explicitly state whether the 150% increase is based on the initial purchase price alone or the total investment. However, the most common interpretation in real estate when referring to an increase in value due to repairs would be based on the initial purchase price, as the value increase is typically a reflection of the property's market value appreciation, not the sum of costs incurred.

Therefore, based on the typical real estate valuation practice and the more common interpretation of such scenarios, Agent 3qfQ's approach seems to be the most reliable. The profit should be calculated based on the increased value from the initial purchase price, not the total investment.

The final result, based on the most reliable interpretation, is a profit of $70,000.

The answer is D
